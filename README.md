## Shopify Base.
A really sparse starting point for **Shopify theme development**. The code and guidelines are based on my own requirements.

#### Template Guidelines
Always try and keep liquid `output` and `tag`, as close to Shopify's own guidelines as possible. Make use of `filters`.

Use liquid `{% comment %}` where possible as this won't be rendered in the HTML.

Also make use of your `settings.html` file. Add in general wording, theme styles, etc.
